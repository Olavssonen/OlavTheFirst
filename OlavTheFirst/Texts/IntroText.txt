Welcome to the world of Arbor Domus!

You have awoken alone in a dark and magical place. 
You are sourounded by a thick forrest consisting of tall green trees. 
There is only one path leading out of the small clearing you are standing in. 
Just before you start walking you take a look at yourself as you do not remember anything else than your name.
